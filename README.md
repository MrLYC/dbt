A framework for running self-updating, signed binary tools from a central, trusted repository.

# Overview

DBT consists of a binary ```dbt``` and a config file.  The ```dbt``` binary checks a trusted repository for tools, which are themselves signed binaries.

Tools are automatically downloaded, and verified for checksum and signature before running.

The DBT binary itself auto-updates from the trusted repository, and if it's checksum and signature checks out, it executes a 'Single White Female' on itself, replacing itself on the fly with the new version and then running the downloaded tool.

Tools can be anything and do anything- the only limit is the imagination and skills of the author.  Due to the nature of the Go language, everything compiles down to a single binary, and you can easily cross-compile for other OSes and Architectures.

This allows the author to make tools that do things that can be truly 'write once, run anywhere' - for any desired degree of 'anywhere'.  Furthermore, the tools and dbt itself are self-updating, so every time you use it, you're using the latest version available.  

For backwards compatibility and emergencies, you can also specify the version of a tool, and use any old version in your trusted repository.  The default, however will be to get and use the latest.

If the trusted repo is offline, or unavailable, you can choose to degrade gracefully to using tools already downloaded.  

You can also choose to limit where your tools can run.  It's all up to you.  DBT is a framework, and frameworks are all about *enablement*. 

# Why?

I had a recent experience where a great many people did not agree with or accept that part of being a conscientious computer user was keeping their systems and tools up to date.  Expecting people to pay attention to upgrade announcements, or even run things like ```brew upgrade``` regularly was not only too much.  It was viewed as offensive, and a failure on my part as a toolsmith.  *wow huh?*

Necessity is, as they say, the mother of invention though, so I worked out a way to slice that particular Gordian Knot.  What I came up with was a way I could make everyone happy.  Users were happy because they didn't need to concern themselves with updates.  I could also make *myself* happy, because I could make sure the system was secure, reliable, and had some fall back.  What I came up with I now offer to you as 'DBT'.

Whether the particular folks that drove me to this extreme were right or wrong is not really important.  It turns out there is actually a legitimate use case for self-updating tooling beyond simply appeasing user laziness.

Imagine this, you've got a system of dynamic VM's and Containers, all leveraging common tooling.  You might even have a serious DAG or web of 'things' dynamically generating other 'things' in a busy and automated fashion.  What is there's a problem, or an upgrade?  With normal utility tools and scripts you have to re-bake your machine images and containers to pick up the changes.  You might say that that's a good thing.  But what if it's not?

With DBT, you have the best of both worlds.  You can force your tools to use an explicit version (```dbt -v 1.2.3 <tool>```).  You can also dispense with the '-v' and run the latest.  Voila!  You're automatically picking up the latest version of the tooling from your trusted repository.


# Security

DBT is as secure as the repository you trust to hold the binaries, and the degree to which you protect the signing keys.  It will ensure, come hell or high water that every bit of the binary downloaded is what it aught to be, and that the signature is one you've decided to trust.  If it can't do that, it'll stop- immediately and scream bloody murder.  

You can make the repo wide open, and give everyone a copy of a non-encrypted key and it'll work.  It's just not recommended.  I just build the tools.  You choose how to use them.

*"If you aim the gun at your foot and pull the trigger, it's UNIX's job to 
ensure reliable delivery of the bullet to where you aimed the gun (in
this case, Mr. Foot)."* -- Terry Lambert, FreeBSD-Hackers mailing list.

# Repository Support

The initial versions of DBT are targeted at the [Artifactory Open Source](https://www.jfrog.com/open-source) repo.  Any sort of WebDAV server that supports authenticated REST should work fine though.

# Configuration

Dbt uses a config file typically located in ~/.dbt/conf/dbt.json

An example dbt config file:

        {
          "dbt": {
            "repository": "http://localhost:8081/dbt",
            "truststore": "http://localhost:8081/dbt/truststore"
          },
          "tools": {
            "repository": "http://localhost:8081/dbt-tools"
          }
        }
        
It contains sections for the ```dbt``` tool itself, as well as for the tools dbt will download and run.

The individual sections are detailed below.

## dbt

This section applies to the ```dbt``` binary itself.  The ```dbt``` binary doesn't do much in and of itself beyond download , verify, and run tools, but this is where you set the degree of paranoia on the system by setting the truststore.

It's also conceivable that ```dbt``` itself might need a higher level of paranoia than the tools.  It's all up to you.

### repository

Url of the trusted repository.

### truststore

Url of the truststore.  This file contains the public keys of the trusted authors of dbt binaries.  This can be a single ascii armored public key such as:

There's nothing magical about this file.  It's just the keys you've decided to trust.  You're free to maintain it by hand if you like, or you can use the dbt tool ```trustmgr``` https://github.com/nikogura/trustmgr 

### tools

This section is for the tools ```dbt``` downloads, verifies, and runs for you.

#### repository

Url of the repo where the tools are stored.  This is where tools are found, and where the tool ```catalog``` https://github.com/nikogura/catalog  looks for tools.

# Prebuilt Tools

The whole point of DBT is that you'll create your own tools to do things your way, but there are some common tasks that any user of DBT might want at their fingertips.

The following is a list of tools that you might want to consider using as is, or as a basis for your own awesomeness:

To use them, all you need to do is clone the repo, modify the ```metadata.json``` file to point at *your* repository, and run ```gomason publish```.  It should *just work*.

* *[Catalog](https://github.com/nikogura/catalog)*  A tool for showing what tools are in your repository.

* *[Creator](https://github.com/nikogura/creator)*  A tool for generating tool boilerplate.  You could do it by hand, but why?

* *[Trustmgr](https://github.com/nikogura/trustmgr)*  A tool for managing who's public keys are trusted by DBT.
